A library management system that supports both online reservations and in-person check-outs would need to handle
concurrent requests and maintain consistency in its data. This would be a relatively complex system,
but let's sketch out a basic flow of operations:

1 Initialization: Start the system and establish a connection with the database. The database will be the single
source of truth for all operations. Create necessary GUI interfaces for in-person check-outs.

2 User Authentication: If your system supports user accounts, users (both online and in-person) need to authenticate
before they can access the library's resources. Online users will do this over the web, while in-person users might
swipe a library card at a check-out counter.

3 Book Search: Both online and in-person users should be able to search the library's collection. As we discussed,
these search operations should be performed on separate threads to keep the system responsive.

4 Reservations/Check-outs: Users can either reserve a book for later pickup (online) or check out a book immediately
(in-person). These operations involve changing the status of a book from 'available' to 'checked-out', which should be
immediately reflected in the database to prevent other users from attempting to check out the same book.
Because these operations alter the state of the library, they should be done in a way that ensures data consistency
(e.g., by locking the relevant row in the database while the operation is in progress).

5 Notifications: The system should regularly check the database for any books that are due soon or overdue, and notify
the relevant users. This can be done on a separate thread.

6 Returns: When users return books, the system needs to update the status of the books in the database and possibly
notify users who have reserved those books.

If you're looking to build a system that can support multiple check-out counters and online users, one important
thing to keep in mind is the issue of concurrency. Multiple threads could potentially try to access and modify the
same data at the same time, leading to inconsistencies.

To manage this, you would need to use synchronization techniques. For instance, you could use locks to ensure that
only one thread can modify a book's status at a time. In SQL, this could be achieved through transactions and
row-level locking.

As a final point, if you want to keep extendability in mind, consider using design patterns and principles that
support maintainability and scalability, like the Single Responsibility Principle, the Open/Closed Principle,
and the Model-View-Controller pattern. These concepts can help you structure your application in a way that makes
it easier to add new features in the future.
