An Event-Driven system with an EventManager is definitely one way to handle this situation, and it can provide a lot
of benefits like loose coupling and better responsiveness. The event manager would handle events such as "reserve book",
"check out book", and "return book".

Here is a rough sketch of how this might look:

Event Manager: This class would maintain a queue of events and process them one by one. Each event would be a request
for a certain operation (like reservation, check out, etc.). The event manager would run on its own thread and wait for
new events to arrive in the queue. Once an event arrives, it would take it off the queue and process it.

Events: You would define different types of events for different operations. Each event could be a Runnable
(or Callable if you need to return a result) that encapsulates the logic of the operation it represents.
The events would interact with the database to perform their operations.

Event Producers: The GUI and other parts of your system would be event producers. Whenever a user interacts with the
system (like clicking a button to reserve a book), an event would be created and added to the event manager's queue.

This architecture ensures that all operations that interact with the database are funneled through a single point
(the event manager), which can help manage concurrency and ensure data consistency.

Here is a rough sketch of what the code could look like:

class EventManager extends Thread {
    private Queue<Runnable> events = new LinkedList<>();

    public void addEvent(Runnable event) {
        synchronized (events) {
            events.add(event);
            events.notify();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        while (true) {
            Runnable event;
            synchronized (events) {
                while (events.isEmpty()) {
                    try {
                        events.wait();
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        return;
                    }
                }
                event = events.poll();
            }
            event.run();
        }
    }
}

class ReserveBookEvent implements Runnable {
    // ... constructor and fields ...

    @Override
    public void run() {
        // perform the reservation operation
    }
}

// To use these classes:
EventManager eventManager = new EventManager();
eventManager.start();
eventManager.addEvent(new ReserveBookEvent(/* parameters */));



Remember to handle synchronization carefully in this setup. You don't want two events modifying the database at
the same time. Also, note that while this setup ensures that events are processed in the order they're received,
it doesn't necessarily guarantee that they're processed immediately (since events are processed one at a time,
a long-running event could delay the processing of subsequent events).


using an abstract Event class or an Event interface can provide a consistent structure for all events and make it
easier to add new types of events in the future. Here's an example of how you might do this:


interface Event extends Runnable {
    // You can define additional methods here if needed
}

class ReserveBookEvent implements Event {
    // ... constructor and fields ...

    @Override
    public void run() {
        // perform the reservation operation
    }
}

class CheckOutBookEvent implements Event {
    // ... constructor and fields ...

    @Override
    public void run() {
        // perform the check-out operation
    }
}

class EventManager extends Thread {
    private Queue<Event> events = new LinkedList<>();

    public void addEvent(Event event) {
        synchronized (events) {
            events.add(event);
            events.notify();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        while (true) {
            Event event;
            synchronized (events) {
                while (events.isEmpty()) {
                    try {
                        events.wait();
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        return;
                    }
                }
                event = events.poll();
            }
            event.run();
        }
    }
}

// To use these classes:
EventManager eventManager = new EventManager();
eventManager.start();
eventManager.addEvent(new ReserveBookEvent(/* parameters */));
eventManager.addEvent(new CheckOutBookEvent(/* parameters */));



In this setup, every Event is a Runnable, so you can process it in your EventManager. This structure makes it easy
to add new types of events: just create a new class that implements the Event interface, and your EventManager will
be able to handle it. This is in line with the Open/Closed Principle we discussed earlier: your EventManager is open
for extension (you can add new types of events) but closed for modification (you don't have to change its code to
add new types of events).
