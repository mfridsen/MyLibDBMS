Notifications for due dates n shit

GUI? No, but use SwingUtilities.invokeLater(Runnable) to schedule the GUI setup code to run on the EDT.
If you're initializing and setting up your GUI (adding components, setting properties, etc.) outside the context of
the EDT, you should explicitly make sure that the initialization happens on the EDT
Here's an example:

  public static void main(String[] args) {
      SwingUtilities.invokeLater(new Runnable() {
          public void run() {
              // create and display the GUI here
              MyGui gui = new MyGui();
              gui.setVisible(true);
          }
      });
  }
